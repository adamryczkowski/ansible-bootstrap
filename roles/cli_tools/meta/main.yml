# CLI Tools role metadata
#
# This role supports two profiles:
#   - minimal: Basic CLI tools for a functional command-line experience
#   - full: Enhanced CLI experience equivalent to --cli-improved flag
#
# The 'full' profile requires the rust role to be applied first for
# installing Rust-based CLI tools via cargo-binstall.
