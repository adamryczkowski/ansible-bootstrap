Remarks:\n\nToday is 22th of October 2025.\n\nCompleting the task may involve use or knowledge of tools and libraries. Assume that these tools and libraries changed substantially, and you need to do the Web research in order to use them correctly.\n\nBe prepared to do a Web search on every step of your progress towards the goal of this task as needed. When you do Web search:\n1. Use the browsermcp to do the web search.\n2. Start with general web search (DuckDuckGo or Google) unless you are dead-sure about a specific source URL.\n3. When using web search make sure to check at least five different places\n4. Provide the links to the sources you actually used.\n5. Don't open PDF files via Web search; use pdf-reader-mcp for this.\n\nWhenever the problem involves advanced knowledge of an open-source tool or library, consider downloading its source code from GitHub or other repository hosting service and inspecting the source code to understand how it works.\n\nIf the command you executed took long and there is \"^C\" in the terminal, you assume that the command was interrupted because the operator decided it was taking too long. In this case, you should not assume that the command was successful.\n\nNever execute long and complex command-lines, because you often make mistakes in quoting. Instead, either break them down to smaller pieces, or write a small script and run that.\n\nIf the task requires reading local files make sure to first list their location with either `git ls-tree  --name-only -r $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)` or `fd` command first.\n\nTry hard not to use command line to edit source files. Use dedicated tools that are at your disposal.\n\nThe local system is running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. With the following alias in .bashrc:\n`alias cat=bat`. Bat is an interactive tool by default; use `cat --paging=never <file>`.\n\nYou can rely on ripgrep `rg` command being installed.\nYou can rely on fd-find `fd` command being installed.\n\nIf the task involves working with Python project and there is `pyproject.toml` in the project's root, assume it is a poetry project and use `poetry run` if you expect the command to be run in the project's environment.\n\nDon't assume you know how to write Asciidoc and asciimath (stem) syntax. Always check the documentation using web search: https://asciimath.org/ and https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/\n\nWhenever you edit a justfile, don't assume you know the syntax, but always check the documentation using web search: https://just.system/man/en\nWhenever you add a tool to pre-commit, make sure to check the documentation of the tool, and research how it can be integrated to the pre-commit first.\n\nWhenever the task requires some work to do in the remote Linux system, follow the following rules:\n1. Use the `ssh-server`, but only the interactive sessions therein. It means for command execution use `ssh_start_interactive_shell`, `ssh_send_input` and `ssh_read_output`, but never use `ssh-connect` and `ssh_execute`.\n2. Unless said otherwise, connect as user `adam` with the private SSH key /home/adam/.ssh/id_ed25519 (no passphrase, port 22).\n3. Do not prefix the commands with `bash` because bash is the default handler for the connection in the remote server. Connections will persist, so subsequent commands will run in the same session, preserving environment variables and session state.\n4. Every remote command must be simple and short. Avoid conditionals and commands requiring nested quoting. \\\n5. Every remote command that has potential side effects or is potentially destructive must be confirmed with the operator before executing it with a clear explanation of the rationale behind it, the expected outcome, and the possible risks.\n6. For every remote command document in `remote-work-log.md` the intention, input, output (stdout and stderr) and interpretation of the outcome."},"includeTaskHistoryInEnhance":true,"reasoningBlockCollapsed":true,"enterBehavior":"send","profileThresholds":{},"hasOpenedModeSelector":true,"lastSettingsExportPath":"/home/adam/Downloads/roo-code-settings.json","lastTaskExportPath":"/home/adam/Downloads/roo_task_feb-9-2026_8-15-40-am.md"}}
