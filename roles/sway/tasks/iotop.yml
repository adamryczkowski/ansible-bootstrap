# Sway role - Configure iotop for disk traffic monitoring
#
# This task installs iotop and sets capabilities to allow the user to
# run iotop without sudo, which is required for waybar's disk traffic display.
#
# The disk-traffic waybar script uses iotop to monitor per-process disk I/O.
# Setting capabilities is preferred over sudoers for security.
#
# Note: Debian/Ubuntu uses 'iotop-c', Arch uses 'iotop'
